\description{
tmx_genotypic_effect allows you to explore the concept of genotypic effect at a locus.
The d and h increments of the gene difference A – a. Aa may lie on either side of m and the sign of h will
vary accordingly; in the case illustrated h would be negative. (Adapted from Mather and Jinks, 1977, p. 32).
See book issue 23
This function lets you explore the simplest two–allele system (A and a), with three possible genotypes, AA, Aa, and aa.
Parameter "a" is half the measured difference between the homozygotes AA and aa. The point between the two homozygotes is "m" -- the mean effect of homozygous genotypes. "d" defines the measured deviation effect of the heterozygote Aa, relative to this expected midpoint. "a" and "d" are genotypic effects.

old system:

$d$ =  half the homozygotes difference (midpoint = $m$)

$h$ = measured deviation of the heterozygote from $m$

new system:

u, v -> p, q

d, h -> a, d
