\usage{
umxOrdinalObjective(df, suffixes = NA, covName = "expCov",
  meansName = "expMean", threshMatName = "threshMat", vector = FALSE,
  deviationBased = FALSE, droplevels = FALSE, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{the data being modelled (to allow access to the factor levels and quantiles within these for each variable)}

\item{suffixes}{e.g. c("T1", "T2") - Use for data with repeated observations in a row (i.e., twin data) (defaults to NA)}

\item{covName}{is the name of the expected-covariance matrix (Defaults to "expCov")}

\item{meansName}{is the name of the expected-means matrix (Defaults to "expMeans")}

\item{threshMatName}{= "threshMat"}

\item{vector}{= FALSE}

\item{deviationBased}{Whether to build a helper matrix to keep the thresholds in order (defaults to = FALSE)}

\item{droplevels}{Whether to drop levels with no observed data (defaults to FALSE)}

\item{verbose}{(defaults to FALSE))}
}
\value{
- list of thresh matrix, fit function, and expectation.
}
\description{
High-level helper for ordinal modeling. Creates, labels, and sets smart-starts for this complex matrix. I think
I will deprecate this, as it does too little and hides too much to be worth supporting...
}
\details{
When modeling ordinal data (sex, low-med-hi, depressed/normal, not at all, rarely, often, always),
a useful conceptual strategy to handle expectations
is to build a standard-normal model (i.e., a latent model with zero-means, and unit (1.0) variances),
and then to threshold this normal distribution to generate the observed data. Thus an observation of "depressed"
is modeled as a high score on the latent normally distributed trait, with thresholds set so that only scores above
this threshold (1-minus the number of categories).
