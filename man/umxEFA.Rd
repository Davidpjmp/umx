\description{
A helper for EFA that only requires you to choose how many factors and offer up manifest data.
This is very much early days. I will add "scores" if there is demand, but you are better off
making a CFA model and getting scores from that with \code{\link{mxFactorScores}}.
}
\details{
You can create an EFA either by specifying some factor names:

umxEFA(factors = c("g", "v"), data = mtcars)

or

umxEFA(factors = 2, data = mtcars)

\emph{notes}: In an EFA, all items may load on all factors.
For identification we need m^2. We get m * (m+1)/2 from fixing factor variances to 1 and covariances to 0.
We get another m(m-1)/2 degrees of freemdom by fixing the upper-right hand corner of the factor loadings
component of the A matrix.

EFA reports standardized loadings: to do this, we scale the data.

Bear in mind that factor scores are indeterminate and can be rotated.

\examples{
vars = c("mpg", "disp", "hp", "wt", "qsec")
m1 = umxEFA(name= "test", factors = "g", data = mtcars[, vars])
m2 = umxEFA(name= "test", factors =   2, data = mtcars[, vars])
loadings(m2)
m3 = factanal(~ mpg + disp + hp + wt + qsec, factors = 2, rotation = "none", data = mtcars)
loadings(m3)
