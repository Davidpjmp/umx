Several scales in the data are described in  van der Aa et al (2010).
General Family Functioning (GFF) refers to adolescents' evaluations general family health
vs. pathology. It assesses problem solving, communication, roles within the household,
affection, and control. GFF was assessed with a Dutch translation of the General Functioning
subscale of the McMaster Family Assessment Device (FAD) (Epstein et al., 1983).

Family Conflict (FC) refers to adolescents' evaluations of the amount of openly 
expressed anger, aggression, and conflict among family members. Conflict
sub-scale of the Family Environment Scale (FES) (Moos, 1974)

Quality of life in general (QLg) was assessed with the 10-step Cantril
Ladder from best- to worst-possible life (Cantril, 1965).
