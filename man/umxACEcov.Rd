\description{
Make a 2-group ACE Cholesky Twin model (see Details below)
}
\details{
A common task in twin modelling involves using the genetic and environmental differences 
between large numbers of pairs of mono-zygotic (MZ) and di-zygotic (DZ) twins reared together
to model the genetic and environmental structure of one, or, typically, several phenotypes
(measured behaviors).

umxACE supports a core model in behavior genetics, known as the ACE Cholesky model
(Cardon and Neale, 1996). This model decomposes phenotypic variance into Additive genetic, 
unique environmental (E) and, optionally, either common or shared-environment (C) or 
non-additive genetic effects (D). This latter restriction emerges due to a lack of degrees of 
freedom to simultaneously model C and D with only MZ and DZ twin pairs {ref?}. The Cholesky or 
lower-triangle decomposition allows a model which is both sure to be solvable, and also to 
account for all the variance (with some restrictions) in the data. This model creates as 
many latent A C and E variables as there are phenotypes, and, moving from left to 
right, decomposes the variance in each component into successively restricted 
factors. The following figure shows how the ACE model appears as a path diagram:

\strong{Data Input}
The function flexibly accepts raw data, and also summary covariance data 
(in which case the user must also supple numbers of observations for the two input data sets).

\strong{Ordinal Data}
In an important capability, the model transparently handles ordinal (binary or multi-level
ordered factor data) inputs, and can handle mixtures of continuous, binary, and ordinal
data in any combination. An experimental feature is under development to allow Tobit modelling.

The function also supports weighting of individual data rows. In this case,
the model is estimated for each row individually, then each row likelihood
is multiplied by its weight, and these weighted likelyhoods summed to form
the model-likelihood, which is to be minimised.
This feature is used in the non-linear GxE model functions.

\strong{Additional features}
The umxACE function supports varying the DZ genetic association (defaulting to .5)
to allow exploring assortative mating effects, as well as varying the DZ \dQuote{C} factor
from 1 (the default for modelling family-level effects shared 100% by twins in a pair),
to .25 to model dominance effects.
