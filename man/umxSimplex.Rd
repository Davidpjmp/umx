Make a 2-group simplex twin model
The common-pathway model provides a powerful tool for theory-based decomposition of genetic
and environmental differences.

umxCP supports this with pairs of mono-zygotic (MZ) and di-zygotic (DZ) twins reared together
to model the genetic and environmental structure of multiple phenotypes
(measured behaviors).

Simplex path diagram:

\figure{simplex.png}

As can be seen, each phenotype also by default has A, C, and E influences specific to that phenotype.


Like the \code{\link{umxACE}} model, the CP model decomposes phenotypic variance
into Additive genetic, unique environmental (E) and, optionally, either
common or shared-environment (C) or 
non-additive genetic effects (D).

Unlike the Cholesky, these factors do not act directly on the phenotype. Instead latent A, 
C, and E influences impact on one or more latent factors which in turn account for variance in the phenotypes (see Figure below).


\strong{Data Input}
Currently, the umxCP function accepts only raw data. This may change in future versions.

\strong{Ordinal Data}
In an important capability, the model transparently handles ordinal (binary or multi-level
ordered factor data) inputs, and can handle mixtures of continuous, binary, and ordinal
data in any combination.

\strong{Additional features}
The umxSummary function supports varying the DZ genetic association (defaulting to .5)
to allow exploring assortative mating effects, as well as varying the DZ \dQuote{C} factor
from 1 (the default for modeling family-level effects shared 100% by twins in a pair),
to .25 to model dominance effects.

\strong{Matrices and Labels in the simplex model}
A good way to see which matrices are used in umxSummary is to run an example model and plot it.

The loadings specific to each time point are contained on the diagonals of matrices 
`as`, `cs`, and `es`. So labels relevant to modifying these are of the form "as_r1c1", "as_r2c2" etc.

All the shared matrices are in the model "top". So to see the 'as' values, you can simply execute:

m1$top$as$values

The transmitted loadings are in matrices at, ct, et.

The innovations are in the matrix `ai`, `ci`, and `ei`.

Less commonly-modified matrices are the mean matrix `expMean`. This has 1 row, and the columns are laid out for each variable for twin 1, followed by each variable for twin 2.

So, in a model where the means for twin 1 and twin 2 had been equated (set = to T1), you could make them independent again with this script:

m1$top$expMean$labels[1,4:6] =  c("expMean_r1c4", "expMean_r1c5", "expMean_r1c6")
}

mzData <- subset(iqdat, zygosity == "MZ")
dzData <- subset(iqdat, zygosity == "DZ")

selDVs = tvars(baseVarNames, sep = "_T", suffixes= 1:2)

m1 = umxSimplex(selDVs = selDVs, sep = "_T", dzData = dzData, mzData = mzData)
umxSummary(m1)
parameters(m1, patt = "^c")
m2 = umxModify(m1, regex = "TeA_r1c1", name = "dropA", comp = TRUE)
