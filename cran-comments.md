## Changes
* Multiple enhancements across many old and new functions.
This package has not been undated on CRAN for several months now, because OpenMx is a dependency
and it is failing checks on MacOS due to issues which we have repeatedly failed to resolve.

I would appreciate being able ot update umx while we continue to negotiate with CRAN/Simon to find out 
why we can build OpenMx just fine locally, and build with travis, but the package is failing for one version
of one platform on the CRAN buiild with a new non-standard build chain. 

## Test environments
* OS X 10.13.0, R version 3.4.2
* Win (64-bit) R Under development (unstable) (2017-07-31 r73003)
* 64-bit Linux (Scientific Linux 6), R 3.4.1

## R CMD check results
* No ERRORs, No WARNINGs, No NOTES

## Downstream dependencies
* No downstream dependencies.

Many thanks!
