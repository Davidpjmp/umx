## Changes
As requested, I now don't run examples which open the browser (these had been present for several years).
There are multiple new features as well.

Hopefully allows package to be re-instated (was removed 2018-01-25).

The package likely can't be tested on El Capitan, as the mac CRAN pipeline currently fails building 
OpenMx binaries for El Cap (we can build them fine locally)

## Test environments
* OS X 10.13.0, R version 3.4.3
* Win R Under development (unstable) (2018-01-30 r74185)
* 64-bit Linux (Scientific Linux 6), R 3.4.3

## R CMD check results
* One example time WARNING, No ERRORs, No NOTES

## Downstream dependencies
* No downstream dependencies.

Many thanks!
