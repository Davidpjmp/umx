## Changes
As requested, don't run examples which open diagrams in the browser.

The package likely can't be tested on El Capitan, as CRAN currently lacks a binary build of OpenMx for El Cap.

## Test environments
* OS X 10.13.0, R version 3.4.3
* Win R Under development (unstable) (2017-09-12 r73242)
* 64-bit Linux (Scientific Linux 6), R 3.4.2

## R CMD check results
* No ERRORs, No WARNINGs, No NOTES

## Downstream dependencies
* No downstream dependencies.

Many thanks!
