## Resubmission
This is a resubmission (of a New submission).

In this version I have addressed each request as follows:

* "Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION": OpenMx & umx are correct package names.
* used `utils::globalVariables()` to scope vars declared in OpenMx functions but
  that codetools cannot find.

## Test environments
* OS X 10.11, R version 3.2.2 (2015-08-14)
* Win x86_64-w64-mingw32, R Under development (unstable) (2015-08-20 r69138)
* 64-bit Linux (Scientific Linux 6), R 3.2.0

## R CMD check results

No ERROR or WARNINGs resulted.
There is a NOTE that this is a new submission

## Downstream dependencies

There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.

Best wishes, tim
