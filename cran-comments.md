## Changes
Wanting to get this package back on CRAN: Please let me know what to do, if anything, 
Now getting emails from students, and researchers who depend on it.

As requested, I now don't run examples which open the browser (these had been present for several years).

Multiple new features as well.

Hopefully allows package to be re-instated (was removed 2018-01-25).

Please ignore the failure on El Capitan - it is true for all packages that depend on OpenMx
as CRAN currently fails to build OpenMx for El Cap.
Builds with the same toolchain on our hardware build and run fine.

## Test environments
* OS X 10.13.0, R version 3.4.3
* Win R Under development (unstable) (2018-02-09 r74240)
* 64-bit Linux (Scientific Linux 6), R 3.4.3

## R CMD check results
* No WARNINGs, No ERRORs, No NOTEs

## Downstream dependencies
* No downstream dependencies.

Many thanks!
