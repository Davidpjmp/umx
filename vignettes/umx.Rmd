## Overview of umx 

This clearly is a pre-draft: I am just starting to write a vignette.

Until then (and probably after, as the help is very helpful), start with ?umx

## Figures

The figure sizes have been customised so that you can easily put two images side-by-side. 

```{r, fig.show='hold'}
plot(1:10)
plot(10:1)
```
